# Data visualization

> “The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device.” -- John Tukey

This lab is all about preparing publication-ready figures with `ggplot2` and related packages. `ggplot2` uses elegant syntax and it implements ["The Layered Grammar of Graphics"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf).

Before we begin, let's review a few key points for good figures:

1. **Be clear and avoid confusion**. Presenting too much information often results in messy figures. Figures inconsistent in colour, symbols, etc. can easily confuse readers.

2. **Only use additional aesthetic effects when necessary.** Everything in a graph has a purpose. The primary objective of a figure is to inform, not to look fancy (though this is a plus). When in doubt, stick to black, white, and grey.

3. **Only use texts when necessary.** Make text large. Never use Comic Sans as your font. Sans serif fonts such as Arial and Calibri are usually good bets.

**Key point:** the plot depends on the variables. Some plots are more appropriate for visualization than others. You have an obligation to display data responsibly. Check out [The R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) for a "dictionary" on different visualizations and the code to create them.

Recall that the `tidyverse` contains `ggplot2` and `dplyr` among other packages. We'll also load `gapminder`.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

Hopefully by now you have a good idea of what the `gapminder` dataset looks like. Here's a quick refresher:

```{r}
head(gapminder)
```


## A graphing template

Although we've presented graphs with `ggplot2` in previous labs, let's delve into the specifics of the syntax:

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

Everything in the initial `ggplot()` function is passed into the subsequent functions (i.e., `GEOM_FUNCTION()`). When calling `ggplot()`, you don't explicitly need to write `<ARGUMENT> = ` (ex: `data = gapminder`, `x = lifeExp`) as long as you have the variables in the correct order -- just be careful you don't mix up `x` and `y`!

`ggplot2` works in a layer-by-layer manner. Take a look at this:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap))
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point()
```

Here, the first line initializes the object and the second line adds a layer of scatter points. Unlike plotting in base R, you don't need to specify variables using the `$` operator -- `ggplot2` is smart enough to call it automatically for you.

I'd like to bring your attention to the `+` operator. This is how you add layers to the ggplot. Use `+` liberally to reduce excessively long lines; breaking long commands at appropriate places makes your code much more readable.


## Scatter plot

Use the scatter plot when you want to see the relationship between two continuous variables.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

You also can save the object as a variable. To show the figure, use the `show()` function or simply call the object by its name.

```{r, eval=F}
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
show(p)  # method 1
p        # also works
```

This data might benefit using a log scale. You can either log-transform (`log(gdpPercap)`) or simply draw the x axis in log scale (`scale_x_log10()`).

```{r}
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
show(p)
```


### Trend lines

It seems that there exists a positive correlation between the two variables -- you might want to add a trend line. Remember, `p` is the object of scatter plot with x in log. We can just build from here. This just goes to show the beauty of layered graphical syntax.

```{r}
p + geom_smooth()
```

You find that R used 'gam' model as default. 'gam' is the generalized additive model. Without going into the mathematical details, you would expect a curve from gam.

What if I want a straight line (i.e., linear regression)? I would want a straight line to start with. Let's start with a linear model (`lm`).

```{r}
p + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

We can also create a generalized linear model (`glm`). `glm` can be useful if your variables are not normally distributed.

```{r}
p + geom_smooth(method = 'glm')
```

It appears that`lm` and `glm` don't look too different.

Notice that `lm` has a little shaded region around it. This correspondends to the confidence interval of 1 standard error. To get rid of it, specify `se = FALSE`. While we're at it, let's change the colour of the line to red and decrease its thickness. Let's also remove that pesky grey background:

```{r}
scatter_trend <- p + theme_classic() +         # removes grey background
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',
                se = F,       # remove confidence band
                col = 'red',  # change colour of line to red (hex colours also work: #FF0000)
                size = 0.75)  # set width of line
show(scatter_trend)
```


### Facets

If you were paying careful attention, you may have noticed that we were using data from multiple years. However, this results in a messy, and potentially misleading, graph. Let's fix this by plotting each year separately with the facet feature.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(year), nrow = 3, ncol = 4) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw()  # another ggplot2 theme
```

We can use faceting to split by the combination of two variables. Here I will use facet_grid to put the same values of splitting variables on the same row/column. Note that you also need to specify `vars(year)` and `vars(continent)` instead of just `year` and `continent`. This is simply to help `ggplot` retrieve the levels in a particular column.

```{r}
gap.52.77.07 <- gapminder %>% filter(year %in% c(1952, 1977, 2007))
ggplot(data = gap.52.77.07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(year), cols = vars(continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw()
```


## Aesthetic mappings

A scatter plot places dots using x and y coordinates. What if we want to show more detail, like which point(s) correspond to a particular group? For example, what if we want to see how life expectancy vs GDP per capita varies per continent in 1977?

```{r}
gap.77 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 1977)
ggplot(data = gap.77, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=continent)) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

You can see the points from some continents, like Europe and Africa, cluster at distinct positions.

In addition to adding colours to show (categorical or continuous) groupings, we can also use

  1. Shape of points (categorical),
  2. Size of points (continuous), or
  3. Transparency/alpha of the points (continuous).

These options are all specified within aesthetic mappings (`aes()`). That is, `aes()` is the place you specify how you present your variables. More specifically, it's how you map your variables to various aesthetics. To repeat an earlier point, `aes()` within the `ggplot()` function applies to ALL layers, while those in other layers only applies to that specific layer.

Here's another example. Be careful with this as R interprets `year` as a continuous variable. Use `as.factor()` or `factor()` to circumvent this issue,

```{r}
ggplot(data = gap.52.77.07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = as.factor(year))) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

Going back to our original example of lifeExp vs gdpPercap by continent, I use `stat_elipse()` to enclose the points within a 95% confidence interval.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year == 1977), 
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  # color only applies to the points, not the eclipses
  geom_point(aes(color=continent)) +
  # stat_ellipse uses level=0.95 by default
  stat_ellipse() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

We can also create multiple ellipses to group things together. Note that `color = continent` is the same as `colour = continent` and `col = continent`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year == 1977), 
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  # color applies to both points and eclipses
  geom_point() +
  stat_ellipse() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

What if we want to also visualize population size in addition to grouping by continent?

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year == 1977), aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=continent, size=pop)) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

Here we run into a minor problem: some dots are overlapping. We can fix this by applying `geom_jitter()` with partial transparency.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year == 1977), aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.7, aes(color=continent, size=pop)) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

Notice that `geom_jitter()` adds some random variation, or jitter, to each point. While this is a handy method to address overplotting, don't rely on it too heavily. This is illustrated in the next plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color=continent, size=pop, alpha=year)) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

As you can see, this is a fancy figure, but also a messy figure. This plot has "information overload," so we would like to simplify it. To reduce the amount of information, we come back to facets. Be careful with this one as R interprets `year` as a continuous variable. Use `as.factor()` or `factor()` to circumvent this issue,

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.65, aes(size=pop, color=as.factor(year))) +
  facet_wrap(vars(continent)) +
  scale_x_log10()
```
  
Finally, we can change the labels and text formats. Here, we can save the figure to a .png format. Alternatively, you can save the figure using the Export tab in the Plots viewing panel in RStudio.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.65, aes(size=pop, color=year)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(continent)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life Expectancy", size = "Population", color = "Year") +
  theme_bw() +                           # remove the gray background
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))  # make texts larger
show(p)

ggsave("data/08_ggplot2/Life_GDP.png", plot = p)
```


## Line plot

A line plot is another way to visualize continuous variables. This is particularly useful when 

  1. Your observations change over time and
  2. You want to demonstrate a causal relationship. 

Let's elaborate on the second point. In the previous case for life expectancy and GDP, we could only observe a correlation, but cannot conclude a causal relationship. In some case, such as carrying out a laboratory experiment or a simulation study, you can precisely manipulate certain independent variables and measure other dependent variables. This way you can argue for a better causal relationship. For example, you can change the concentration of a drug treatment and measure the inhibition effect.

Let's take a look at the life expectancy of Africa over the years. Let's first create a scatter plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, continent == "Europe"), aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

Since the points can correspond to the countries, we can connect them with lines.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, continent == "Europe"), 
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, colour = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = country))
```

Here the `group = country` specifies that points with the same values for the variable `country` should be connected in a line.

Oftentimes you want to show line plots with mean values and error bars. Unfortunately, ggplot2 can't automatically draw error bars -- you have to explicitly specify the values. We're going to address this in the next example.

First, calculate the mean and SEM and save it to a new data frame.

```{r}
df <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  summarise(mean_le = mean(lifeExp), sd=sd(lifeExp), sem = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
```

Next, draw a line plot with this data frame. To draw error bars, we need to specify the upper and lower limits within `geom_errorbar()`.

```{r}
lineplot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = year, y = mean_le, color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_le-sem, ymax = mean_le+sem),
                position = position_dodge(0.05))  # position_dodge() sets length of error bar caps
show(lineplot)
```

Finally, let's format the figure nicely.

```{r}
lineplot <- lineplot + labs(x = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy", color = "Continent") +
  theme_classic() +                      # remove the gray background
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))  # set font size
show(lineplot)
```

For a cleaner view with offset axis:

```{r}
lineplot <- lineplot +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),  # hide the default axes
        axis.ticks.length = unit(7, 'pt')) +
  # specify the breaks of y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(40,80,20), limits=c(35,85), expand=c(0,0)) +
  # specify the breaks of x-axis
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950, 2010, 20), limits=c(1945,2010), expand=c(0,0)) +
  # specify the location of the new y-axis
  geom_segment(y=40, yend=80, x=1945, xend=1945, lwd=0.5, colour="black", lineend="square") +
  # specify the location of the new x-axis
  geom_segment(y=35, yend=35, x=1950, xend=2010, lwd=0.5, colour="black", lineend="square")
show(lineplot)

ggsave("data/08_ggplot2/life_year.png", plot = lineplot)
```


## Bar plot

### Basics

Let's look at the life expectancy of all continents in 1977 using a bar plot. Notice that instead of using `dplyr`, we can simply use the base R `subset()` function. Recall `df` from the previous section.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(df, year == 1977), aes(x=continent, y=mean_le)) +
  geom_col()
```

Note by default, `geom_col` takes both x and y while `geom_bar` takes only x and plots the count on y. Just as before, we can add error bars:

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(df, year == 1977), aes(x=continent, y=mean_le)) +
  geom_col() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_le - sem, ymax = mean_le + sem), width=0.5,
                 position=position_dodge(0.05))
```

We can compare 1977 and 2007 by setting`fill = as.factor(year)`.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = subset(df, year %in% c(1977, 2007)), 
       aes(x=continent, y=mean_le, fill = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(), color = "black") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_le - sem, ymax = mean_le + sem), width=0.5,
                 position=position_dodge(0.9))
show(p)
```

Finally, let's make this figure publication-ready:

```{r}
p <- p +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('black', 'white')) +
  labs(x = 'Continent', y='Mean life expectancy (years)', fill = 'Year') +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=16)) +
  # removes space between bottom of bars and x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))
p
```


### Plotting significance (OPTIONAL)

Next we can run some statistical tests and add significance stars (*) to the plot. We'll compare if the life expectancy in Africa in 1977 and 2007 has changed.

```{r}
africa.1977.lifeExp <- gapminder %>% filter(continent == 'Africa', year == 1977) %>% select(lifeExp)
africa.2007.lifeExp <- gapminder %>% filter(continent == 'Africa', year == 2007) %>% select(lifeExp)
t.test(africa.1977.lifeExp, africa.2007.lifeExp)
```

The p-value is 0.001917. Here are common ranges for different p-values: 0 **** 0.0001 *** 0.001 ** 0.01 * 0.05 ns 1. We should use ** in this case. To draw the significance stars, we need the `ggsignif` package.

```{r}
# install.packages("ggsignif")
library(ggsignif)
meanLE.77.07 <- p + geom_signif(y_position = 60, xmin = 0.75, xmax = 1.25, # position of the stars
              annotations = "**", tip_length = 0.05)
meanLE.77.07
```

There are more ways to draw the significant stars in R. For example, `ggpubr` even allows you to run the tests and plot the stars in the same line. 

However, I do not encourage you to do so. Manually adding the stars might be a bit tedious (in terms of adjusting the positions and tip length), but you are not as restricted by the package in terms of the tests you can do.


## Box plot

Box plots are extremely versatile. Here are 2 reasons:

  1. You don't need to calculate the mean and error for box plots (remember we used `df` for bar plots).
  2. Many high-profile journals ask authors to submit graphs that shows not only the statistical description (mean and error), but also the dots for the raw data. Box plots are well suited for this purpose.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year %in% c(1977, 2007)), 
            aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(0.8))
show(p)
```

Let's add the data points. Here I use `geom_jitter` to avoid overlapping. Please note that `position_jitterdodge` introduces random noise to the x position of the points to make it easier to read. But since we are plotting against a categorical variable, the exact x position doesn't matter.

```{r}
p <- p + geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(0.4), alpha = 0.65)
```

Use `stat_summary` show data points and statistics together.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
p <- ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year %in% c(1977, 2007)), 
            aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(0.4), alpha = 0.65) +
  theme_classic() +
  # adds error bar
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_sdl, fun.args = list(mult=1),
        geom="errorbar", width=0.3, position = position_dodge(0.7), size = 1) +
  # adds mean pooint to the error bar
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", position = position_dodge(0.7), size = 3)
show(p)
```

Add asterisks and format the plot.

```{r}
p <- p +
  geom_signif(y_position = 85, xmin = 0.75, xmax = 1.25, annotations = "**", tip_length = 0.02, color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Continents", y = "Life Expectancy (years)", color = "Year") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))  # make text larger
show(p)
```

We can again offset the axes.

```{r}
offset_box <- p +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),  # hide the default axes
        axis.ticks.length = unit(7, 'pt')) +
  # Specify the breaks of y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(30,90,30), limits=c(25,95), expand=c(0,0)) +
  # Specify location of x-axis
  geom_segment(y=30, yend=90, x=0.4, xend=0.4, lwd=0.5, colour="black", lineend="square") +
  # Specify location of y-axis
  geom_segment(y=25, yend=25, x=1, xend=5, lwd=0.5, colour="black", lineend="square")
show(offset_box)
```

Now we can save this publication-ready figure.

```{r}
ggsave('data/08_ggplot2/life_year_jitter.png', plot = offset_box)
```


## Histogram and density plot

Since these have been covered extensively in previous labs, I'm going to go through this section rather quickly. The histogram and density plot are great tools for looking at distributions of a single variable:

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year == 2007), aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = '#69B3A2')
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year == 2007), aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density(fill = '#69B3A2')
```

We can also use these plots to compare distributions.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  # 2007 data and label
  geom_density(data = subset(gapminder, year == 2007),
               aes(x = lifeExp, y = ..density..), fill = '#69B3A2') +
  geom_label(aes(x=40, y=0.03, label='2007'), colour = '#69B3A2') +
  # 1977 data and label
  geom_density(data = subset(gapminder, year == 1977),
               aes(x = lifeExp, y = -..density..), fill = '#404080') +
  geom_label(aes(x=40, y=-0.03, label='1977'), colour = '#404080') +
  theme_minimal()
```

Perhaps a histogram would be better for our purposes.

```{r}
hist.07.77 <- ggplot() +
  # 2007 data and label
  geom_histogram(data = subset(gapminder, year == 2007),
                 aes(x = lifeExp, y = ..density..), fill = '#69B3A2') +
  geom_label(aes(x=40, y=0.03, label='2007'), colour = '#69B3A2') +
  # 1977 data and label
  geom_histogram(data = subset(gapminder, year == 1977),
                 aes(x = lifeExp, y = -..density..), fill = '#404080') +
  geom_label(aes(x=40, y=-0.03, label='1977'), colour = '#404080') +
  theme_minimal()
hist.07.77
```


## Assembly of multiple figures (OPTIONAL)

Many figures in academic journals include multiple subfigures within a figure. 

To assemble many graphs into one figure, usually we use a graphical design software such as Illustrator, Inkscape or even PowerPoint. 

If you are able to generate all subfigures within one single R script (so that all the `ggplot2` objects are present together), you could go on to use R package `patchwork` to assemble them into a big figure.

(Please note that this could be a very rare scenario when conducting serious research - Each subfigures may require intense computation and modelling work that are performed with several scripts. They may even come from different people - your teammates and collaborators. You don't always have access to all te subfigures within one workspace. Most of the time you would still find yourself using graphical design softwares to assemble the figures.)

```{r}
# install.packages('patchwork')
library(patchwork)
```

Here is a super simple example: just add the plots together! Recall that these variables were saved throughout our lab.

```{r}
hist.07.77 + lineplot
```

We can also do something a bit more complicated:

```{r}
(hist.07.77 + lineplot) / offset_box
```

We can also add spacing between plots:

```{r}
patch <- (hist.07.77 + plot_spacer() + lineplot) /
  (meanLE.77.07 + theme(text=element_text(size=12)))
patch
```

Most figures in papers are annotated. We can do the same: '1' for Arabic numerals, 'A' for uppercase Latin letters, 'a' for lowercase Latin letters, 'I' for uppercase Roman numerals, and 'i' for lowercase Roman numerals. Note here that the sizing 


```{r}
(hist.07.77 + lineplot) / (meanLE.77.07 + theme(text=element_text(size=12))) +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')
```

More often than not, we want all of our figures to have the same dimensions. `patchwork` makes it easy for us to do so:

```{r, eval=F}
aligned_plots <- align_patches(lineplot, scatter_trend, meanLE.77.07, offset_box)
for (p in aligned_plots) {
  plot(p)
}
```

That's all there is to it! If you want more customization options, read the official documentation: https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/patchwork.html.


## Extras (OPTIONAL)

### Choropleth

> “The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” --John Tukey

[The choropleth](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/choropleth.html) is used to display differences in geographical regions using different colours/shades/patterns. To use map data, we need to install `maps` package.

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("maps")
```

First, let's load `maps` and retrieve all of the data from the year 2007.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(maps)
dat2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
dat2007 <- dat2007 %>% rename('region' = 'country')
```

Now let's get the world map data. This is necessary because it contains the longitude and latitudes we need to draw the map

```{r}
world_map <- map_data("world")
head(world_map)
```

Whereas `gapminder` names USA and UK 'United States' and 'United Kingdom' respectively, `world_map` names them by their abbreviations. Let's rename the `gapminder` data.

```{r}
dat2007 <- dat2007 %>% mutate(region = fct_recode(region,
                             'USA' = 'United States',
                             'UK' = 'United Kingdom'))
```

We're almost there! Now, we need to merge the data.

```{r}
life.exp.map <- left_join(world_map, dat2007, by = "region")
head(life.exp.map)
```

Finally, we can plot the data. We specify `group` to draw each country individually.

```{r}
# grey means no gapminder data
ggplot(life.exp.map, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = lifeExp), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_b(option='D') +
  theme_bw()
```

### Animations

While we covered the most relevant data visualizations for your project, we've barely scratched the surface of what R can do. For example, you can create animations. Let's install the `gganimate` package.

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/gganimate')
```

Next, load the package:

```{r}
library(gganimate)
```

Finally, we can create the plot! This might take a while, but I promise it will be worth the wait!

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, col = country)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = F) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
    scale_x_log10() +
    scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
    facet_wrap(~continent) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
    # here is the animation code
    labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'Life expectancy (years)') +
    transition_time(year) +
    ease_aes('linear')
```

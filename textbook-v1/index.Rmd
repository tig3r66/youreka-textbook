# Welcome to Youreka Canada {-}

Welcome to Youreka Canada! In our program, you will learn how to wrangle data, perform statistical tests, and visualize data with R. The purpose of this textbook is to provide a companion to the [Youreka Canada program](https://yourekacanada.org/), which provides research and data science education.


## How to use this textbook {-}

This textbook emphasizes the various data science applications that can be performed using the R programming language. As with all things programming, the best way to learn is to actively code. So, as you use this textbook, open RStudio and play around with the presented code---try to find alternative solutions, or even break the code. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, and soon enough, you will be confident to code on your own!

Please note that this textbook goes into additional detail not covered in the Youreka Program. All optional material is marked as OPTIONAL.


## Contributors {-}

This textbook was written by Eddie Guo, Pouria Torabi, Shuce Zhang, and Devin Aggarwal, who are part of the Youreka Canada Programs Team. A special thanks goes to Matthew Pietrosanu for his critical statistical review of the Youreka program.
